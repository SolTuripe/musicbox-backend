# Music Box BackEnd 📻

This project is part of a hackathon that took place on february 16 and 17 \
We have to create a marketplace with the minimum viable product:

* A home page with a list of all ads
* A show page that shows more information about the ad

In this repository we create the Api for our Music Box marketplace \
[You can access the front of Music Box here](https://github.com/SolTuripe/MusicBox_Frontend)

## Tech Stack & Tools 🛠

- JAVA
- Spring Boot
- Intellij IDEA

## Project Setup 📌

We use Spring Boot

* We start by creating the project with [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/)
```
Maven project
Dependencies: Spring Web, Spring Data JPA and MySQL Driver
```

* You can clone the repository here: https://github.com/SolTuripe/musicbox-backend.git
```
- cd musicbox-backend
- You have to create a file with the name "application.properties" and fill with the information from your database, you can use the example file "application.properties.example"
- Create a table named "products" in MySQL
- Now you can run the Api
- The path to use to connect the FrontEnd to the Api is: localhost:8080/products
```
